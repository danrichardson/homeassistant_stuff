# homeassistant_stuff

This is a collection of my Home Assistant works-in-progress

The first commit is my primary dashboard that adapts whether it is on a mobile device or laptop.

I included some raw files, and some scripts that broke those files into smaller chunks (helpers)

Added a YouTube walkthrough of the dashboard.
